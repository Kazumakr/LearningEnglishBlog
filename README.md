## Description

### Why I created this project

I created this blog because I wanted a blog to output what I had learned about English.
I used to have a blog using WordPress, but it was closed down and I wanted to create a new one this time with a different technology.

I wanted to use tailwind and TypeScript.

### what I learned through this project

I had built a blog using nextjs and sanity before, so I was familiar with data handling, but I had a lot to learn about using TypeScript and Tailwind.
I feel more familiar with TypeScript. I was surprised at how easy it is to create responsive designs using Tailwind.
